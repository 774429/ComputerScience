Knowing that liv-<br>ing conditions may vary, we provide nonperishable food items along with fresh fruit. We also wish to provide items that are easily prepared. Backpack Buddies runs on donations alone and look for sales and deals when purchasing our food. Brands may change, but overall ingredients in the bag remain the same. </p4><style>p4 {
