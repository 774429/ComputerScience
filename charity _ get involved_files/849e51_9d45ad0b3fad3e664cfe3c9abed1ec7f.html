<html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"></head><body><p4 style="font-family:&#39;Cambria &#39;">We operate solely on a dedicated group of volunteers and we’d love to have you join us! There are different ways to get involved.     During the school year we pack bags, nearly every week, on Thursday eve-nings. Some volunteers take one week each month and others fill in, here and there, when their schedule allows. Volunteers pick up and deliver food to our headquarters twice a month and they deliver bags to each elementary and mid-dle school each week. We also have various fundraising events that could not happen without volunteers.<br>Looking for a place to get involved?
